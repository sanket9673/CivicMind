            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating
                learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits
                and personal development.
                Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion
                and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators; however, learners can also educate themselves.

                Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any
                experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
                Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as
                preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college,
                university, or apprenticeship. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a
                certain age. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Technology ("science of craft", from
                Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and -λογία, -logia[2]) is the sum
                of any techniques, skills, methods,

                and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the

                accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation.

                Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like,

                or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation

                without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e.g. machines)

                applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to

                the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as

                technology systems or technological systems. </p>
